        <h1>Memory Quiz</h1>
        <p>This interactive game invites you to engage with the eye-catching snapshots of the research taking place in the School of Physics in a playful and thought-provoking way. Based on the classic memory tiles game, the challenge goes beyond simply matching identical images.</p>
        <p>Instead, you’ll flip tiles by answering quiz-style questions — each correct match developing deeper layers of understanding. The goal is not just to recall what you’ve seen, but to connect concepts, visuals, and ideas from the world of physics.</p>
        <p>Need help along the way? The Study Notes are always available. You can explore them at any time to learn more about the images and the science behind them.</p>
        <h1>The Art of Physics</h1>
        <p>The Art of Physics project showcases the beauty and complexity of physics research – theoretical, experimental and computational. The artworks are on display in the Physics Building (A28) on the Camperdown campus.</p>
        <p>Creativity is a vital part of scientific enquiry. From capturing the wonder of the distant Universe to developing experiments to trap individual atoms for quantum computation, physics research requires deep specialist knowledge, as well as thinking about things we know in radically different ways.</p>
        <p>This project celebrates this meeting of art and science. Each image is an eye-catching snapshot of the research taking place in the School of Physics. Some of the images are from the real world, some show simulations, and others are more traditional artworks.</p>
